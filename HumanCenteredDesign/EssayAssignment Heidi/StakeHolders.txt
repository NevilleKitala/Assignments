(HC)You are designing a monitoring system for premature babies in the neotal ward in hospital.
Who are the primary ,secondary ,tertiary and facilitating stakeholders you will need to involve and why?

The primary stakeholders are those directly using the system. The stakeholders involved in the monitoring
system of the premature babies include the hospital, doctors and nurses that are taking care of them. Another primary stakeholder would be the engineer who makes the system. On the
other hand secondary stakeholders are the direct beneficiaries of the system . In this case this includes
the babies and their parents. This is because through the use of the monitoring
system the babies can grow to maturity. A tertiary stakeholder in this case would be the government. This is
because they benefit through an increase in population due to succesful premature births.
