(HC)  Using the pact framework describe the relationship between a user and technology
 of your choice.
 
 The Pact Framework is a method of analysis that is used to describe how people use
technology to undertake activities in context. The word PACT is an abbreviation for
People, Activities, Context and Technology. An example of this is a student who searches
for the meaning of a word using google in the library. People, in this case, 
are represented by the `student` doing the search. The activity being done is `searching
for the meaning of the word`. The environment in which this interaction was made is `in the
library`. This is its context. Finally, the technology used was `google`.
