(HC) Imagine the HCI for a new set of augmented reality sports glasses for elite cyclists.
Explain the design choices you would make to create useful and usable interface for the
 cyclist thinking especially about reducing the gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution.
 
The augmented reality functionality in pro cyclist glasses must be implemented in such a manner
that it is not too distracting to the cyclist. This can be achieved by the use of arrows
to assist with navigation which could be accompanied by an audio description of the intended 
route. The colors should be bright so that it is visible but not distracting, for example,
white. The ability to use voice commands to turn the display on and off depending on whether
the cyclists wants it on or not is neccesary. Information about distance covered and speed
of the cyclist can also be displayed, however this needs to be small so it does not interfere
 with the cyclists field of view.
